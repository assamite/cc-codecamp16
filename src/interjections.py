.. py:module:: interjections
    :platform: Unix
    
Generate common English interjections for given stimulation. The available 
interjections have been created mostly according to this 
`site <http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/interjections/>`_.

Intended usage follows roughly this scheme:: 

    >>>import gensim, interjections
    >>>model = gensim.models.Word2Vec().load("/path/to/my/trained/model")
    >>>interjections.get('annoyed', model)
    'sheeeshh'
    >>>interjections.get('happiness', model)
    'whheee'
